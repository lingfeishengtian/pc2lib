PC2 Library to Edit Settings

Documentation is in the code. Extractor is **EXTREMELY** important so you better look at it.


To use this library, make sure you run your programs with the additional vm option.

```java
-Djdk.crypto.KeyAgreement.legacyKDF=true
```

Make sure you are importing from com.lingfeishengtian and not from pc2 libraries.
